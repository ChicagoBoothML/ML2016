I will use R in the classroom.
You will find some pointers on this page.

You can download R from [here](https://www.r-project.org/).

- [Install R for Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A56PD8BSS0A)
- [Install R for Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGkG7Gg6j0)

At the time of creating this webpage, the current version of R is **version 3.2.4**.

_Note: If you have R already installed on your computer, please make sure that
it is the latest version. Otherwise, you may encounter difficulties._

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a very useful interface for R.
You can download it from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

### Additional resources

Many people are using R and you will often find a solution to your problem via Google.  
For example, [How to make a histogram in R](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+to+make+a+histogram+in+R).

Me, TA, and your classmates. Ask questions on the discussion board [Piazza](https://piazza.com/chicagobooth/spring2016/bus41000/home),
work together with your classmates, and answer other's questions.
