## Piazza Discussion Forum

[**https://piazza.com/chicagobooth/winter2017/bus41204/home**](https://piazza.com/chicagobooth/winter2017/bus41204/home)

You can add yourself to the course here: [**https://piazza.com/chicagobooth/winter2017/bus41204**](https://piazza.com/chicagobooth/winter2017/bus41204)

We will be using Piazza for class discussion.
Please post any questions that you may have there, rather than emailing TAs or instructors.
All of your classmates will benefit from the public discussions.

We also encourage you to answer other students' questions.
Answering question will reinforce your learning and understanding of the material.
We will carefully check all discussions and give clarification in case of any confusion.
Sometimes the best answer may be "Let me Google that for you..."


## Course Summary

Machine Learning is the very core of modern Data Analytics, which companies big and small are leveraging
to mine commercial value out of their increasingly vast troves of information. This course aims to give you an introduction to a wide range of popular, powerful and highly practical Machine Learning algorithms,
with the hope that what you take away here will help you rise up to data-enabled commercial opportunities in your subsequent careers.

You will learn about state-of-the-art Machine Learning techniques and how to apply them in business related problems.
We will introduce techniques in the context of business applications and
emphasize how Machine Learning can be used to provide insights and create value from data.

The first, and biggest, part of the course will focus on **Predictive Analytics** / **Supervised Learning**.
You will learn about Decision Trees, Nearest-Neighbor Classifiers, Boosting, Random Forests,
Deep Neural Networks, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.
Among other examples, we will apply these techniques to detecting spam in email,
click-through rate prediction in online advertisement, image classification, face recognition,
sentiment analysis and churn prediction. You will learn what techniques to apply and why.

In the second part of the class, you will learn about **Unsupervised Learning** techniques for
extracting actionable patterns from data. Examples include Clustering, Collaborative Filtering,
and Dimensionality Reduction with applications to customer segmentation,
recommender systems, graph and time series mining, and anomaly detection.


## Prerequisites		

This course does not require sophisticated mathematical knowledge nor extensive programming experience.
However, the nature of the material is somewhat technical.

**BUS 41000** (**Business Statistics**) or **BUS 41100** (**Applied Regression**) is highly recommended.
You should be familiar with basic Probability and Linear Regression. If you have taken neither of these courses, you can still take Machine Learning if you have a strong quantitative background. However, in case there are gaps in your background, we expect that you fill those gaps as soon as possible,
or withdraw from the course otherwise.

In addition, you should be familiar with **programming in R**, a platform for statistical analysis.
Students in the previous year found using **R** harder part of the course compared to necessary mathematical background.

## Computing

All computing in class will be conducted in R.
The focus of the class will be on teaching Machine Learning concepts rather than how to use R.

Our colleague Matt Taddy (of _BUS 41201_ Big Data fame) lists some useful resources
for learning R [here](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/matt.taddy/teaching).

_Other programming languages:_
There are many programming languages that have readily available Machine Learning libraries.
You are free to use any of them in your homework and projects.
However, if you opt to do so, we may not be able to provide much support.


## Textbooks

There are no required textbooks. All materials notes will be available on the class website.

_Optional textbooks:_ Books below do not cover all the material we plan to cover in the class.
We list both technical books and business related books.

[**An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R**](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL) <br>
*Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani* <br>
This book provides a great introduction to Machine Learning.
Concepts are well explained, without too much technical details. <br/>
_PDF available online_

[**Elements of Statistical Learning**](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn) <br>
*Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman* <br/>
This book covers similar material to the one above, however, it provides more technical material. <br>
_PDF available online_

[**Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective**](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook) <br>
*Kevin Murphy* <br>
PhD-level book, providing a encyclopedic survey of the area.

The following three books are very light on technical details,
but do talk about applying Machine Learning in the context of business applications.

[**Data Science for Business**](http://data-science-for-biz.com) <br>
*Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett* <br>

[**Predictive analytics**](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118416856.html) <br>
*Eric Siegel*

[**Big Data, Data Mining, and Machine Learning: Value Creation for Business Leaders and Practitioners**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1502462915) <br>
*Jared Dean*

Optional references on R. [Here](Computing) are additional resources.

[**R in a Nutshell**](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022008.do) <br>
*Joseph Adler*

[**A Beginner's Guide to R**](http://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Guide-Use-Alain-Zuur/dp/0387938362) <br>
*Alain Zuur, Elena N. Ieno, Erik Meesters*

## Evaluation

_Grades_ will be determined by:

- homework -- 4 assignments (18%)

    These assignments can be done in groups (max size 5). You should submit only one write-up per group. Homework assignments will be uploaded through [gradescope.com](https://gradescope.com/). The uploaded homework could be a scan of handwritten solution or a typed solution. Submission should have a clear and professional presentation.

- participation on Piazza (2%)

    Ask good questions and answer other students questions. Cannot be done anonymously if you want to get credit.

- a midterm exam (40%)

    There is a **take-home midterm** that will be posted in week 5 and will be due in week 6. You must work individually on the midterm.


- a final project (40%)

    The **final project** must be done in a group. The goal will be to apply Machine Learning to a particular business problem. More details about the project can be found [here](../project).

Students must adhere to Booth Honor Code. But you do not need to include the honor code, and signatures, etc., on your work.
