Your class project is an opportunity for you to explore an interesting Machine Learning problem of your choice
in the context of a real-world data set. Your class project must be about new things you have done this semester; you can't use results you have developed in previous semesters. We will provide some project ideas here, but the best idea is to combine Machine Learning with a problem in your business area.

Project should be done in a group of 4 or 5 people. 


Here are examples of successful projects from past:

* [Facial Keypoints Detection](https://piazza.com/class_profile/get_resource/ixiudyq1m7bj0/ixjtnuml5zz797)  
* [Predicting mutual fund returns using machine learning tools](https://piazza.com/class_profile/get_resource/ixiudyq1m7bj0/ixjtnlzxoh53lm)  
* [Predicting mutual fund returns using machine learning tools](https://piazza.com/class_profile/get_resource/ixiudyq1m7bj0/ixjtmyt1or4o7)  
* [Diamonds](https://piazza.com/class_profile/get_resource/ixiudyq1m7bj0/ixjtnbnpbv61po)  

**Deadlines:**

  - _Project Proposal:_ Week 5
  - _Project Presentation:_ Week 10
  - _Project Write-up:_ Week 11


## Project Proposal

Proposals should be one page maximum.

Include the following information:

  - _Project Title_
  - _Team members_
  - _Data Set._ Briefly describe data set that you are going to use. You should have access to this data set, rather than promissing to collect data.
  - _Project Idea._ Describe what you want to achieve. What Machine Learning tools are you going to use?
  How is the data set going to help you answer your question?

Think of the project proposal as an early draft of your final write-up.
Ideally you will be able to start from your proposal and expand it to the final document.


## Where to get data

## Project Write-Up

Create a professional-grade report on your project.
Imagine a very statistically savvy client who would read your report.
The report should not be longer than 12 pages, including figures and your analysis.
You do not need to include your R code with the submission.
However, in case you decide to include it, please do so in the appendix.

Your report should summarize what was the goal of the project, what data you used, what did you do to your data and why.
Tell us what did you learn from the project. Did you manage to solve a particular business problem using machine learning tools?
If your method did not do as well as you were expecting, could you elaborate as to why?
What conclusions can you draw from the project?
